Welcome to my attempt at a revival of a dupe for our beloved classic Yik Yak!

Yik Yak, before its recent official revival with new and updated features, was a simple social media platform popular among college students.

The app would allow users to post anonymously, and each post would have the ability to be upvoted or downvoted. Users on classic Yik Yak would have a feed compromised of posts submitted within a local distance from them.

For simplicity's sake, I will be leaving out the location feature, and focusing on my MVP features:
  - displaying anonymous posts from multiple users
  - giving each post an upvote and downvote button that keeps track of the popularity (or unpopularity; negative scores are possible) score
    for each anonymous post

If time allows, I would like to incorporate the following stretch features:
  - allowing replies with upvote snd downvote options to anonymous posts

The simple days of classic Yik Yak allowed users to connect and share some laughs and confessions with fellow students at their universities

*** Please use this classic Yik Yak appropriately and responsibly ***
